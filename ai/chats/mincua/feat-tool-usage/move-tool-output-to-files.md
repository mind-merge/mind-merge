We'll be improving the tool usage support by making the output of the tools be saved to separate files in the resources folder
instead of in the chat file. The chat file will hold a reference to the output files that will pe matched and parsed 
when the chat is loaded, just like the referenced files.

# Agent

To implement the improvement of saving the output of tools to separate files and referencing these files in the chat file, I will organize the task into the following steps:

### Plan

1. **Update the Data Model:**
   - Modify the `Chat` and `Message` classes to include properties for tool output file references.
   - The `Message` class will have an array of strings to store the paths to tool output files related to that message.
   - The contents of the files will be expanded in the message contents when the chat is loaded, similar to how referenced files are handled.

2. **Change Tool Execution Process:**
   - Adjust the `ChatExecutionService` to save tool outputs to separate files in the `resources` folder of each chat. The file names should be meaningful and possibly include the tool name and a timestamp.
   - Update tool output handling to generate references to these files instead of including the output directly in the chat file.
   - The references will be written in markdown link format.

3. **Modify Chat Loading Process:**
   - In the `ChatParserService`, add functionality to parse the new tool output file references in chat files and load these files accordingly.

4. **Adjustments in Handling Referenced Files:**
   - Ensure that when a chat is loaded, tool output file references are also loaded and made accessible as part of the chat's context.

5. **Utility Functions:**
   - Create utility functions for generating file paths for tool outputs and for saving outputs to files. This helps in keeping the code DRY and simplifies maintenance or adjustments to the file-naming scheme.

### Assumptions

- The `resources` folder path is will be located in each chat directory.

### Steps

1. **Implement Data Model Updates**:
   - Add tool output file reference properties in the model classes.

2. **Update Tool Execution to Save Outputs Externally**:
   - Modify tool execution in `ChatExecutionService` to save outputs to files.
   - Generate meaningful filenames for each tool execution output.
   - Save these filenames as references in the chat files.

3. **Implement Parsing and Loading of Tool Output References**:
   - Modify the `ChatParserService` to correctly parse and load tool output files referenced in chat files.

4. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Test the entire flow from executing a tool, saving its output, referencing the output in a chat file, and loading the chat file along with the tool outputs.

Let's start implementing this plan. Before diving into the code modifications, do you agree with this approach, or would you like to adjust any part of this plan?

I updated the plan inline above, let's start implementing it

# Agent

Great! Considering the updated plan, we'll start with the implementation phase, focusing first on updating the data model to include references to tool output files.

### Step 1: Implement Data Model Updates

1. **Update the `Message` Class**: We need to add a property in the `Message` class to store references (file paths) to the tool outputs related to that message.

Here's the proposed change to `src/model/message.ts`:

```typescript
export class Message {
    content: string;
    date: Date;
    role: Role;
    toolOutputFiles: Array<string>; // New property to store tool output file paths

    constructor(role: Role, message: string, date: Date, toolOutputFiles: Array<string> = []) {
        this.role = role;
        this.content = message;
        this.date = date;
        this.toolOutputFiles = toolOutputFiles; // Initialize the new property
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Update Tool Execution to Save Outputs Externally

We'll modify the `ChatExecutionService` to handle the tool's output by writing it to a file and saving that file's reference instead of writing the output directly to the chat file. 

1. **Create Utility Functions for File Handling**: We'll start by creating utility functions to help with generating filenames and saving tool outputs.

2. **Modify Tool Execution Process**: Adjust the function that handles tool execution to save the output to a file and update the chat message with a reference to this file.

I'll proceed with creating these utility functions. Let's define a function for generating a unique filename for the tool output and another for saving output to a file within the `ChatExecutionService`.

```typescript
// Add these functions inside the ChatExecutionService class in src/services/chat-execution-service.ts

private generateToolOutputFilename(toolName: string): string {
    // Generates a unique filename for a tool output
    const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
    return `${toolName.replace(/\s+/g, '_')}_${timestamp}.txt`;
}

private async saveToolOutputToFile(toolOutput: string, filePath: string): Promise<void> {
    // Saves tool output to a file
    const fullPath = path.join('resources', filePath);
    await fs.promises.writeFile(fullPath, toolOutput, 'utf8');
}
```

Next, we need to modify the process of executing tools to leverage these utility functions, saving the output externally and referencing it in the message.

I'll provide the modified tool execution snippets in the next steps. Please let me know if everything looks good up to this point or if there are any adjustments you'd like to make.

ok, let's proceed

# Agent

Now, we will modify the tool execution flow to save the output to files and update the chat messages with references to these files. This involves changes in the `ChatExecutionService`, particularly in how we handle the tool response after execution.

### Step 2 Continued: Update Tool Execution to Save Outputs Externally

We will adjust the method that processes model outputs, specifically the part that handles tool calls, in `src/services/chat-execution-service.ts`:

1. **Modify the Tool Output Handling**: After a tool execution, instead of appending its output directly to the chat file, we should save the output to a unique file and reference this file in the chat file.

Here's how we can adjust the processing logic:

```typescript
// Modification to the async processModelOutput method in the ChatExecutionService class:

async processModelOutput(data: Stream<ChatCompletionChunk>, filePath: string):Promise<{output: string, toolsCalled: Array<{args: null | string[], chatMessage: string, name: string, output: string, stdin: null | string}>}> {
    let output:string = '';
    let outputPart:string = '';
    const toolsCalled: Array<{args: null | string[], name: string, output: Promise<string>, stdin: null | string}> = [];
    fs.appendFileSync(filePath, '# Agent\n\n');
    for await (const chunk of data) {
        for (const choice of chunk.choices) {
            if (choice.delta && choice.delta.content) {
                const deltaContent = choice.delta.content;
                fs.appendFileSync(filePath, deltaContent);
                process.stdout.write(deltaContent.toString());
                output += deltaContent.toString();
                outputPart += deltaContent.toString();
                // check for start and end of tool call tags

                const toolCallMatch = outputPart.match(/```tool\n([\S\s]*?)\n```/im);
                if (toolCallMatch) {
                    const toolCall = toolCallMatch[0];
                    const tool = this.toolsService.parseCallAndStartToolExecution(toolCall);
                    toolsCalled.push(tool);
                    outputPart = '';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    const ret = [];
    // Wait for all tools to finish and handle their output
    for (const tool of toolsCalled) {
        const output = await tool.output;
        const toolOutputFilename = this.generateToolOutputFilename(tool.name);
        await this.saveToolOutputToFile(output, toolOutputFilename);
        tool.output = toolOutputFilename;  // Update tool call with filename instead of direct output
        ret.push({
            ...tool,
            chatMessage: `See tool output: [${tool.name} Output](${toolOutputFilename})`,
        });
    }

    // Modify this method to work with the changes done above as per your use case, especially how tool outputs are appended to the chat message or file.
    return { output, toolsCalled: ret };
}
```

Note: The exact modification might need adjustments based on how you're capturing and displaying tool outputs in your application's flow. The key changes are where we wait for tool execution to finish, save the output to a file, and modify the chat message or file to reference this file instead of directly including tool output.

### Next Steps:

- After updating the tool execution and output handling, the next vital step is to adjust the chat loading process in `ChatParserService` to understand and load these tool output file references properly.
  
- This would involve parsing the chat file for tool output file references and loading the contents of these files as part of initializing the chat context.

Before proceeding to update the `ChatParserService`, do we need any adjustments or clarifications on the steps we've taken so far?

# User

ok, I adapted the code and applied it, you can find the latest one in the referenced files, let's move to the next step.

---
# Agent

Great! Moving on to the next step, we will adjust the chat loading process to properly handle the tool output file references. Specifically, we need to enhance the `ChatParserService` so it can parse these file references from the chat markdown and load them similar to how referencedFiles are handled.

### Step 3: Modify Chat Loading Process

To accommodate the tool output file references, the `ChatParserService` must be updated to:

1. **Parse the Chat for Tool Output File References**: Identify parts of the chat markdown that reference tool output files.
2. **Load Tool Output Files and Include in Messages**: Read these tool output files and include their content in the chat messages or keep references to these files in the chat context.

Here's a conceptual outline of changes needed in `src/services/chat-parser-service.ts`:

1. Modify the `parseChatFile` method to identify and process file references in tool output links. Since we're using markdown link syntax for references, you can search for these patterns and extract the file paths.

2. Load the content of these files and either embed directly in messages or maintain references based on your data model.

Due to the existing structure of your code and data models, the exact implementation might vary. The following changes are an illustrative guide:

```typescript
// Inside ChatParserService class in `src/services/chat-parser-service.ts`

async parseChatFile(filePath: string):Promise<Chat | undefined> {
    // Existing code to load and parse chat file...
    
    const messages: Message[] = [];
    // Existing loop over chat chunks

        // Inside the loop, parse each chunk and identify tool output file references
        const toolOutputFileLinks = messageText.match(/\[(.*?) Output\]\((.*?)\)/g); // This regex might need adjustment
        let toolOutputFiles: string[] = [];
        
        if (toolOutputFileLinks) {
            for (const link of toolOutputFileLinks) {
                // Extract file path from markdown link
                const filePathMatch = link.match(/\]\((.*?)\)/);
                if (filePathMatch && filePathMatch[1]) {
                    const toolOutputFilePath = filePathMatch[1];
                    // Option 1: Load content here
                    // const content = fs.readFileSync(toolOutputFilePath, 'utf8');
                    // messageText += `\n\n${content}\n\n`; // Embed file content in message

                    // Option 2: Save reference (chosen here for demonstration)
                    toolOutputFiles.push(toolOutputFilePath);
                }
            }
        }

        // Adjust creation of Message objects accordingly
        messages.push(new Message(role, messageText.trim(), new Date(createdAt), toolOutputFiles));

    // Existing code to finalize chat parsing and return...
    
    // Note: This method would need adjustment based on your exact requirements and data model
}
```

This update involves choosing between directly embedding the tool output file contents in the chat messages or maintaining references to these files for later use. The decision depends on how you intend to use these files within your application.

### Next Step:

- After adapting the chat parsing logic, it's essential to test the entire flow – from executing a tool, saving the output to files, referencing these files in a chat, and finally, loading and parsing these chat files to ensure that the tool outputs are correctly handled.

If you have already made adjustments and updates to the referenced files or if there's any specific area you'd like to focus on next, please let me know. Else, we can proceed to discuss and implement testing strategies for this new functionality.
