We need to make the agent details get passed as template parameters when the liquid template is rendered.

The data for the template rendering is generated in the function generateChatCompletionRequest from the ChatExecutionService. The data is then passed to the TemplateService for rendering.

# Agent

To achieve this task of passing agent details as template parameters when the liquid template is rendered, I will outline a plan comprising several steps. This plan involves modifying the `ChatExecutionService` to include the agent details in the data it passes to the `TemplateService`, and ensuring that the `TemplateService` properly utilizes these details during the template rendering process.

### Plan

1. **Identify Agent Details Structure**: Determine the structure and the kind of details about the agents that should be passed as template parameters. This includes understanding which details are required and how they are structured within the application.

2. **Modify `ChatExecutionService`**: Update the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function within the `ChatExecutionService` to include the necessary agent details in the data payload it sends to the `TemplateService`.

3. **Update `TemplateService`**: Ensure the `TemplateService` is equipped to accept and process the additional agent details as part of its template rendering context.

4. **Test**: Verify that the modified services are correctly passing and utilizing the agent details within the liquid templates.

### Assumptions

- The current implementation of `ChatExecutionService` and `TemplateService` allows for modifications to the data structure they handle and pass.
- The agent details are readily accessible from within the `ChatExecutionService` or can be fetched/integrated with minimal changes.
- All modifications will be made in TypeScript, considering the application's existing codebase is in TypeScript.

### Tools to Use

- **Visual inspection of source files**: To understand the current implementations of `ChatExecutionService` and `TemplateService`.
- **IDE/text editor**: For modifying TypeScript code.

Given the plan, the next step is to start implementing these tasks. Initially, I need to check the project's source files to locate the `ChatExecutionService` and `TemplateService`. Let's identify these files using the appropriate tool.

# User

The ChatexecutionService is located in the file `src/services/chat-execution-service.ts`, the AgentService is located in the file `src/services/agent-service.ts`, the TemplateService is located in the file `src/services/template-service.ts`, the Agent model is located in the file `src/model/agent.ts`, and the Chat model is located in the file `src/model/chat.ts`.
You have those files in the referencedFiles section.

# Agent

Given the locations of the relevant files, I'll proceed to detail out the tasks based on the steps outlined in the plan. These tasks will ensure that agent details are passed as template parameters when the liquid template is rendered.

### Task Breakdown

#### Task 1: Enhance Agent Model
First, ensure that the agent model (`src/model/agent.ts`) includes all necessary details that need to be passed into the template. This might not require changes if the model already contains the needed data.

#### Task 2: Modify `ChatExecutionService`
Update the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function in the `ChatExecutionService` (`src/services/chat-execution-service.ts`) to include agent details in the data payload. This involves:

- Fetching necessary agent details from the `AgentService` or directly within `ChatExecutionService`.
- Including these details in the appropriate structure before passing it to the `TemplateService`.

#### Task 3: Update `TemplateService`
Ensure that `TemplateService` (`src/services/template-service.ts`) can accept and utilize the additional agent details in its rendering context. This might involve updating the method signatures and the rendering logic to handle extra context data.

#### Task 4: Testing
After implementing the changes, testing is crucial to ensure that agent details are correctly passed and rendered within templates. This may involve unit tests or manual testing procedures.

Each of these tasks requires specific code modifications. Let's begin by creating detailed tasks for these work items. The first task will focus on reviewing and potentially enhancing the Agent model to ensure it has all the necessary data.

```task
# Review and Update Agent Model
## Agent: coding-agent

## Description
Review the Agent model located in `src/model/agent.ts` to ensure it includes all necessary details that should be passed into the template. If the model is missing any relevant information that needs to be included as template parameters, update the model to include these properties.

## Expected Outcome
- The Agent model is up-to-date and includes all necessary details that should be passed to the template.
- If updates were made, the model should now have additional properties that are relevant for template rendering.

## File References
- src/model/agent.ts
```

Let's proceed to define the task for modifying the `ChatExecutionService`.

The task output for G:\mind-merge\ai\chats\mincua\agent-details-as-template-params\tasks\0-coding-agent_review-and-update-agent-model-1715320835880.md is listed below, please check it and see what the next steps are:
# Result
The Agent model located in `src/model/agent.ts` has been reviewed and updated. Additional properties that were necessary for template rendering have been added to the model. The updated model now includes a comprehensive set of details that can be used for more effective and informative template generation.

---
# Agent

With the Agent model now including a comprehensive set of details necessary for template rendering, the next step involves updating the `ChatExecutionService` to ensure these details are incorporated into the data payload sent to the `TemplateService`.

### Task 2: Modify `ChatExecutionService`

This task centers on enhancing the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function within `ChatExecutionService` to include the updated agent details in its output. This involves fetching the relevant agent details and incorporating them into the data structure sent for template rendering.

```task
# Enhance generateChatCompletionRequest with Agent Details
## Agent: coding-agent

## Description
Modify the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function in `src/services/chat-execution-service.ts` to include the updated agent details in the data payload sent to the `TemplateService`. To achieve this:
- Use the `AgentService` to fetch the comprehensive agent details now available in the Agent model.
- Incorporate these details into the data structure that is being prepared for the template rendering, ensuring it is passed as part of the context to the `TemplateService`.

## Expected Outcome
- The `generateChatCompletionRequest` function is updated to fetch and include the comprehensive agent details as part of its payload to the `TemplateService`.
- The data payload for template rendering now includes a detailed set of agent information, enhancing the ability to generate informative and context-rich templates.

## File References
- src/services/chat-execution-service.ts
```

Once this update is made, we'll turn our attention to the `TemplateService` to ensure it can utilize these additional details in the template rendering process. Let's await the completion of this current task before proceeding.
