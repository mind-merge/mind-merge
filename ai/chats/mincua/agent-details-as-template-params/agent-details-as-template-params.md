We need to make the agent details get passed as template parameters when the liquid template is rendered.

The data for the template rendering is generated in the function generateChatCompletionRequest from the ChatExecutionService. The data is then passed to the TemplateService for rendering.

# Agent

To achieve this task of passing agent details as template parameters when the liquid template is rendered, I will outline a plan comprising several steps. This plan involves modifying the `ChatExecutionService` to include the agent details in the data it passes to the `TemplateService`, and ensuring that the `TemplateService` properly utilizes these details during the template rendering process.

### Plan

1. **Identify Agent Details Structure**: Determine the structure and the kind of details about the agents that should be passed as template parameters. This includes understanding which details are required and how they are structured within the application.

2. **Modify `ChatExecutionService`**: Update the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function within the `ChatExecutionService` to include the necessary agent details in the data payload it sends to the `TemplateService`.

3. **Update `TemplateService`**: Ensure the `TemplateService` is equipped to accept and process the additional agent details as part of its template rendering context.

4. **Test**: Verify that the modified services are correctly passing and utilizing the agent details within the liquid templates.

### Assumptions

- The current implementation of `ChatExecutionService` and `TemplateService` allows for modifications to the data structure they handle and pass.
- The agent details are readily accessible from within the `ChatExecutionService` or can be fetched/integrated with minimal changes.
- All modifications will be made in TypeScript, considering the application's existing codebase is in TypeScript.

### Tools to Use

- **Visual inspection of source files**: To understand the current implementations of `ChatExecutionService` and `TemplateService`.
- **IDE/text editor**: For modifying TypeScript code.

Given the plan, the next step is to start implementing these tasks. Initially, I need to check the project's source files to locate the `ChatExecutionService` and `TemplateService`. Let's identify these files using the appropriate tool.

The ChatexecutionService is located in the file `src/services/chat-execution-service.ts`, the AgentService is located in the file `src/services/agent-service.ts`, the TemplateService is located in the file `src/services/template-service.ts`, the Agent model is located in the file `src/model/agent.ts`, and the Chat model is located in the file `src/model/chat.ts`.
You have those files in the referencedFiles section.

# Agent

Given the provided information and the files involved, I will detail a specific action plan for implementing the feature to pass agent details as template parameters when rendering the liquid templates.

### Detailed Action Plan

1. **Review and Understand the Current Implementation**:
   - Examine the [chat-execution-service.ts](src/services/chat-execution-service.ts) to understand how data is currently passed to [template-service.ts](src/services/template-service.ts) for rendering.
   - Review [agent-service.ts](src/services/agent-service.ts) to identify how agent details can be accessed.
   - Assess the structure of the agent model in [agent.ts](src/model/agent.ts) to know what details are available.
   - Review the chat model in [chat.ts](src/model/chat.ts) to understand the relationship between chats and agents.

2. **Enhance `ChatExecutionService`**:
   - Modify the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function in [chat-execution-service.ts](src/services/chat-execution-service.ts) to include agent details in the data payload passed to the `TemplateService`. This may involve fetching agent details from the `AgentService` or directly utilizing the chat model if it contains necessary references.

3. **Update `TemplateService`**:
   - Ensure [template-service.ts](src/services/template-service.ts) is updated to handle the agent details received in its context object for template rendering. This might require adjustments to the methods responsible for the rendering process to ensure they properly interpolate the agent details into the templates.

4. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the agent details are correctly passed and rendered within the templates. This should include test cases that cover various scenarios and agent details to ensure reliability and robustness.

### Steps to Execute

Given that the first action is to review and understand the current implementation, I recommend we proceed by reviewing the files mentioned. However, as we're focusing on modifying the code to include the agent details in the template parameters, we will directly approach modifying [chat-execution-service.ts](src/services/chat-execution-service.ts) to include the agent details.

To begin with, let's increment the `ChatExecutionService` to fetch the agent details and include them in the data payload.

```task
# Enhance ChatExecutionService to Include Agent Details
## Agent: coding-agent

## Description
Modify the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function in `chat-execution-service.ts` to query and include agent details from the `AgentService` or directly utilize the chat model if it already contains the necessary references. Ensure these details are included in the payload passed to the `TemplateService` for template rendering.

## Expected Outcome
The `generateChatCompletionRequest` function should now include agent details in its payload for the `TemplateService`. This should allow the liquid templates to render these details as part of their output.

## File References
- src/services/chat-execution-service.ts
```

Following this, I will plan the adjustments needed in the `TemplateService`.
