You are working on the following task:
# Task: Enhance generateChatCompletionRequest with Agent Details
### Description
Modify the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function in `src/services/chat-execution-service.ts` to include the updated agent details in the data payload sent to the `TemplateService`. To achieve this:
- Use the `AgentService` to fetch the comprehensive agent details now available in the Agent model.
- Incorporate these details into the data structure that is being prepared for the template rendering, ensuring it is passed as part of the context to the `TemplateService`.

### Expected Outcome
- The `generateChatCompletionRequest` function is updated to fetch and include the comprehensive agent details as part of its payload to the `TemplateService`.
- The data payload for template rendering now includes a detailed set of agent information, enhancing the ability to generate informative and context-rich templates.

## File References

            agentDetails, // Including updated agent details
        };
