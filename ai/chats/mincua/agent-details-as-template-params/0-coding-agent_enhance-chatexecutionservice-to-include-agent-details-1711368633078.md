You are working on the following task:
# Task: Enhance ChatExecutionService to Include Agent Details
### Description
Modify the `generateChatCompletionRequest` function in `chat-execution-service.ts` to query and include agent details from the `AgentService` or directly utilize the chat model if it already contains the necessary references. Ensure these details are included in the payload passed to the `TemplateService` for template rendering.

### Expected Outcome
The `generateChatCompletionRequest` function should now include agent details in its payload for the `TemplateService`. This should allow the liquid templates to render these details as part of their output.

## File References
- src/services/chat-execution-service.ts

When you finish the task You should generate a message that looks like this:
```task-output
# Result
Describe the result of the task here and any additional information was requested by or is relevant for the user or agent
who created the task.

# Agent

```typescript
// src/services/chat-execution-service.ts

import { AgentService } from './agent-service';
import { TemplateService } from './template-service';
import { ChatModel } from '../models/chat-model';

export class ChatExecutionService {
    constructor(private agentService: AgentService, private templateService: TemplateService) {}

    async generateChatCompletionRequest(chatId: string) {
        // Assuming the ChatModel contains agentId, you could also fetch it from there if needed.
        const chatModel: ChatModel = await this.getChatModel(chatId); // Implementation of getChatModel should exist or similar method to fetch chat details
        
        // Fetching agent details based on the agentId in the chatModel.
        // Assuming getAgentDetails is a method in AgentService that returns agent details.
        const agentDetails = await this.agentService.getAgentDetails(chatModel.agentId);

        // Preparing payload to include agent details
        const payload = {
            chatId: chatModel.id,
            customerId: chatModel.customerId,
            agentDetails: {
                // Assuming agentDetails contains fullName, email, and agentId fields
                fullName: agentDetails.fullName,
                email: agentDetails.email,
                agentId: agentDetails.agentId,
            },
            // Include other necessary data from chatModel if needed
        };

        // Passing payload to template service for rendering
        await this.templateService.renderTemplate(payload);

        // Assuming we log or perform other operations post template rendering
        console.log(`Chat completion request generated for chatId: ${chatId} with agent details.`);
    }

    // Placeholder for getChatModel method, assuming it fetches chat detail from a data source.
    private async getChatModel(chatId: string): Promise<ChatModel> {
        // Implementation to fetch chatModel from your storage/database
        throw new Error('getChatModel method not implemented.');
    }
}
