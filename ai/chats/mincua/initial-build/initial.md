Today we are working on the file reference support feature.

Each chat file can have references to certain files that will be relevant to the chat.

These references will be added to the yaml attributes of the chat file and parsed with matter.

Since the chat md file has attributes that we parse with matter it can also use those attributes to define files that are referenced in the current conversation.
Ex:
```markdown
—-
model: main
file-references:
  - src/services/chat-service.ts
  - src/services/agent-service.ts
—-
# User
…
```

Implementation details:

In the chat parser service we should add a new function called `loadReferencedFiles` that will get passed the matter parsed info for the chat and the new Chat object instance. It should get called right after the chat object is created.

The new function should go through the file references and create `ReferencedFile` objects for each one.

Each ReferencedFile object should have a fileName(the path to the file) and a content - string with the full file content, a mime type and a markdown format name(ex: the typescript mime type should be mapped to `typescript`, the JavaScript mime type should be mapped to `js`, the php mime type should be mapped to `php`, if we don’t have a mapping the markdown format name should fallback to the mime type)

If the agent format is liquid the array with ReferencedFile objects should be set as a variable in the liquid parse function, that variable should be named `referencedFiles`

If the agent format is markdown then the `Agent.prepareAgentForModel` should check this(check agent.format) and include the referenced files in the generated system prompt.

The structure to include files in the prompt is the following:

```

Here is a list of referenced files from the current project and their contents, you can reference information from them when needed.

```markdown
#### src/services/agent-service.ts
``typescript
<<<file contents here>>>
``
```

Here are the mappings:

```markdown
{% foreach referencesFiles as referencedFile %}
#### {{referencedFile.fileName}}
``{{referencedFile.markdownFormat}}
{{referencedFile.contents}}
{% end %}
``
```

In the examples above, the two backticks should be three backticks

The instructions provided outline the steps for implementing a feature in a chat parser service that involves handling file references within chats. Here’s a breakdown of how to implement the feature based on the provided details:

1. **Add a New Function (`loadReferencedFiles`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To process file references in a chat and create `ReferencedFile` objects for each reference.
   - **Location**: This function should be part of the chat parser service and called right after a Chat object instance is created.
   - **Functionality**: It iterates through file references in the chat, creating a `ReferencedFile` object for each one, with properties for fileName, content, mime type, and markdown format name.

2. **ReferencedFile Object**:
   - **Properties**:
     - `fileName`: Path to the file.
     - `content`: String containing the full file content.
     - `mime type`: Type of the file.
     - `markdownFormat`: A name mapped from the mime type for markdown usage (e.g., `typescript`, `js`, `php`, etc. Fallback to mime type if no mapping exists).

3. **Handling Agent Format**:
   - If the agent format is `liquid`, include the array of `ReferencedFile` objects as a variable named `referencedFiles` in the liquid parse function.
   - If the agent format is `markdown`, the `Agent.prepareAgentForModel` function should check the agent format and include the referenced files in the system prompt using the specified structure.

4. **Including Files in Prompts**:
   - For **Markdown-Agents**, follow a specific structure to include referenced files in the system prompt, which allows you to present file contents within markdown code blocks, each preceded by a header with the file name.

5. **Mappings**:
   - A portion of the documentation specifies how to map mime types to markdown format names, ensuring readability and compatibility with markdown standards.

6. **Code Block Example**:
   - The provided examples illustrate how to fabricate the markdown syntax for including referenced files. File contents should be wrapped in markdown code blocks, indicated by triple backticks, with a header for the file name and an indication of the programming language or format for syntax highlighting.

By implementing these steps, the chat parser service will be able to effectively manage file references, making it easier for agents, whether they interpret liquid or markdown, to access and utilize the contents and details of referenced files within their responses or analysis.

Ok, now check the existing code in the referenced files and see if there are any issues with the implementation.

# Agent

Let's examine the implementation details provided in the referenced code files related to handling file references in chat sessions. We'll focus on the `ChatParserService` and associated models to see where the implementation could incorporate handling file references as specified in your feature requirements.

### 1. Loading of Referenced Files

In the provided code base, the `ChatParserService` possesses a method `parseChatFile` which is instrumental in parsing chat files and extracting relevant information, such as agent information and chat messages. However, based on the provided snippets, it does not currently handle the loading of file references.

#### Suggested Changes:

- Implement a method named `loadReferencedFiles` within the `ChatParserService`. This method should take in a list of paths (file references from the YAML front matter) and create `ReferencedFile` objects for each. 

Example Implementation:
```javascript
private loadReferencedFiles(referencedFilesPaths: string[]): ReferencedFile[] {
  return referencedFilesPaths.map(filePath => {
    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    // Determine the mime type and markdown format (not shown here)
    const markdownFormat = 'typescript'; // Placeholder, should actually be determined based on file extension
    return new ReferencedFile(filePath, content, /* mimeType, not handled yet */'text/plain', markdownFormat);
  });
}
```
- Ensure that the `ChatParserService.parseChatFile` method calls this `loadReferencedFiles` method when it encounters the `file-references` attribute in the parsed front matter.

### 2. ReferencedFile Model Enhancement

Based on the proposed feature, the `ReferencedFile` model should include additional properties for `mime type` and `markdownFormat`. However, in the provided `ReferencedFile` class, these properties are not present.

#### Suggested Changes:

- Enhance the `ReferencedFile` class to include the `mimeType` and `markdownFormat` properties:
```javascript
export class ReferencedFile {
    path: string;
    content: string;
    mimeType: string; // New
    markdownFormat: string; // New

    constructor(path: string, content: string, mimeType: string, markdownFormat: string) {
        this.path = path;
        this.content = content;
        this.mimeType = mimeType;
        this.markdownFormat = markdownFormat;
    }
}
```

### 3. Incorporating Referenced Files in Agent Prompts

In the existing implementation, there's no evident mechanism for incorporating the loaded file references into agent prompts, especially for handling differently based on agent file formats (`md` or `liquid`).

#### Suggested Changes:

- For **liquid-based agents**, pass the `referencedFiles` array as a context variable to the liquid template engine. This enables the use of these files in the agent's response generation process.

- For **markdown-based agents**, modify the system prompts construction logic to include the referenced files. This might be part of the `ChatExecutionService` or a separate utility function that preprocesses prompts.

Example Conceptual Implementation:
```javascript
// This is a conceptual approach to modify the prompt for markdown-based agents.
function includeReferencedFilesInPrompt(referencedFiles: ReferencedFile[], originalPrompt: string): string {
    let filesMarkdown = referencedFiles.map(file => {
        return `#### ${file.path}\n\`\`\`${file.markdownFormat}\n${file.content}\n\`\`\``;
    }).join('\n\n');

    return `${originalPrompt}\n\n${filesMarkdown}`;
}
```

These suggestions aim to address potential gaps in the implementation of the file reference support feature based on the provided details. It's important to further refine these solutions, particularly with regard to determining the `markdownFormat` dynamically based on the file mime type.

Ok, can you check now?

Given the existing code snippets and consideration of the new feature you're looking to implement regarding file reference support in chat sessions, I'll reassess the provided source files focusing on how they might accommodate or already accommodate the outlined feature. The critical areas relate to the parsing and incorporation of file references into the chat system:

### Revisiting `ChatParserService`

#### Code Review:

- In `ChatParserService.ts`, the method `parseChatFile` parses the chat markdown file and extracts metadata and chat content using the `gray-matter` library.
- The method `loadReferencedFiles`, as suggested earlier, is key to handling the file references functionality. The provided snippets already include a `loadReferencedFiles` method that dynamically loads the referenced files' content, determines their mime type, and sets a markdown format based on the file's mime type.

  This method aligns well with the proposed implementation plan. It notably processes the `file-references` metadata from the chat file, creating an array of `ReferencedFile` objects containing file path, content, mime type, and markdown format for each referenced file.

### Implementation Insight:

The existing implementation of `loadReferencedFiles` within `ChatParserService.ts` effectively addresses the requirement to process file references from chat markdown files. This includes determining the mime type, handling content loading, and assigning an appropriate markdown format for inclusion in chat prompts.

### Incorporating Referenced Files in Prompts:

The next critical step involves leveraging these loaded `ReferencedFile` objects to augment agent prompts, particularly when rendering agent prompts based on the agent's template format (Markdown or Liquid).

1. **Liquid-based Agents**: For agents utilizing Liquid templates, the `liquidjs` engine must have access to the `referencedFiles` array as part of its rendering context. This allows the template to iterate over and incorporate the contents of referenced files directly into the generated prompt.

2. **Markdown-based Agents**: When handling markdown-based agents, the existing approach needs to inject the referenced files' details into the system's prompt dynamically. The augmentation of the prompt could be handled during the `prepareChatForModel` phase within the `ChatExecutionService`, incorporating the list of referenced files into the prompt as outlined in the suggested code block from the last message.

### Security Consideration:

It's crucial to ensure that the file reference feature does not inadvertently expose sensitive content. Validating the paths of the referenced files to ensure they fall within allowed directories can mitigate potential security risks.

### Summary:

The provided code snippets indicate that the foundational mechanism for handling file references in chat sessions (loading the file content, determining mime types, and setting markdown formats) is in place within the `ChatParserService`.

Further steps involve ensuring that:
- Liquid templates have access to these references.
- Markdown-based prompts dynamically include the content and details of these referenced files.
- Adequate security measures are in place to safeguard against unauthorized file access.

This analysis suggests that the implementation is on the right track regarding loading and parsing file references. To complete the feature, focus on dynamically incorporating these references into agent prompts, tailored to the format used by each agent (Liquid or Markdown).
