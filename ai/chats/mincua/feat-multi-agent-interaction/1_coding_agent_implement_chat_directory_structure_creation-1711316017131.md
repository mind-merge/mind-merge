# User

You are working on the following task:
# Task: Implement Chat Directory Structure Creation
### Description
Implement the functionality for creating the chat directory structure within the `new` command. After parsing the `--user` and `--feature` arguments, check if the directory path `ai/chats/{user}/{feature}` exists. If it does not, create the necessary directories to establish the correct structure.

Handle any potential file system errors, such as permissions issues or disk being full, and provide appropriate error messages to the user.

### Expected Outcome
- The command checks for the existence of the directory structure based on the provided `--user` and `--feature` arguments.
- If the directories do not exist, they are created to match the required `ai/chats/{user}/{feature}` structure.
- Error handling is in place for file system-related errors, providing clear feedback to the user.

## File References
