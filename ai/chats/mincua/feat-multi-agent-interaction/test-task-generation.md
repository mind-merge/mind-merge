We need to add a new command that creates a new chat for the user.

The command should be called `new` and should take the following arguments:
 - `--user` - required, the name of the user that the chat is for
 - `--feature` - required, the name of the feature that the chat is about
 - `--agent` - optional, the name of the agent that the chat is with

The command should create a new chat file in the appropriate directory structure based on the provided arguments(ai/chats/{user}/{feature}/{chat-name}.md).
If the user specifies an agent the file should look like this:
```markdown
---
agent: {agent}
---
# User


```

If the user does not specify an agent the file should look like this:
```markdown
# User

```

---
# Agent

To successfully add a new `new` command that creates a chat for the user in the `mind-merge` CLI application, we'll need to follow a multi-step plan. This involves both creating the command with its arguments and implementing the functionality to create the chat according to the given arguments. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Setup CLI Command Structure**: Define the `new` command structure within the oclif framework, including the required `--user` and `--feature` arguments, as well as the optional `--agent` argument.

2. **Command Argument Validation**: Implement validation for the `--user` and `--feature` arguments to ensure they are provided and meet any specific criteria (e.g., character restrictions). For the optional `--agent` argument, provide default behavior in case it's not supplied.

3. **Chat Directory Creation**: Based on the provided arguments, generate a directory structure to store the chat file. This might involve creating nested directories for the user, feature, and agent.

4. **Chat File Generation**: Create a new Markdown chat file within the appropriate directory. This file should include initial metadata (such as date, time, and involved parties) and be ready to accept further chat entries.

5. **Error Handling and Feedback**: Ensure proper error handling is in place for issues such as missing arguments or file system errors. Provide clear feedback to the user upon successful chat creation or if any errors occur.

6. **Testing**: Write tests to verify that the command works as expected, including scenarios with missing required arguments and proper file structure creation.

7. **Documentation**: Update the CLI tool's documentation to include this new `new` command, detailing its arguments and usage.

8. **Review and Refinement**: Once the feature is implemented, review the code for optimization opportunities and ensure it adheres to the project's coding standards.

For the implementation, I'll assume that we already have the setup with oclif and the necessary project structure to add new commands to the CLI tool.

The next step is to start breaking down this plan into smaller, executable tasks that can be delegated to specific AI agents. We'll begin with the setup of the CLI command structure.

# User

ok, you can now generate code for the new command

# Agent

To generate the code for the new `new` command as outlined in the plan, we'll start with the first part of our plan: **Setting up the CLI Command Structure** using the oclif framework. This task involves creating a new command file and defining the required and optional arguments (`--user`, `--feature`, and `--agent`).

```task
# Setup CLI Command Structure for 'new' Command
## Agent: oclif-coding-agent

## Description
Create a new command called `new` within the oclif framework for the `mind-merge` CLI application. This command must accept three arguments:
- `--user` (string): A required argument that specifies the name of the user the chat is for.
- `--feature` (string): A required argument that specifies the name of the feature the chat is about.
- `--agent` (string): An optional argument that specifies the name of the agent the chat is with.

The command should validate that both `--user` and `--feature` are provided and handle cases where `--agent` is not provided. Use placeholder functions to represent the logic that will process these arguments and generate the chat file, as this will be developed in subsequent tasks.

## Expected Outcome
A new command file is created within the oclif project structure. This file should correctly parse the specified arguments, check for the presence of required arguments (`--user` and `--feature`), and include placeholders for handling the command logic. The `--agent` argument should be optional.

Provide clear help text for the command outlining the usage and the arguments, ensuring the CLI's help documentation will guide users in using the `new` command correctly.
```

This task will establish the foundation for the new command, allowing us to focus on the implementation details of creating chat files and directories in the following steps.

```task-output
# Result
The 'new' command was successfully added to the mind-merge CLI application. This command requires `--user` and `--feature` arguments to be set and allows for an optional `--agent` argument. Basic argument validation ensures that `--user` and `--feature` are always provided. The command is configured and should be discoverable and executable within the CLI's command structure.
```

# Agent

With the `new` command successfully set up in the `mind-merge` CLI application, including the required `--user` and `--feature` arguments, as well as the optional `--agent` argument and basic argument validation, we're ready to proceed to the next steps of our plan:

**2. Command Argument Validation**: Extended validation for command arguments is already handled as part of the initial command setup, ensuring both `--user` and `--feature` are required and establishing `--agent` as optional.

The next logical steps in our process are:

1. **Chat Directory Creation**: Implement the functionality to create the necessary directory structure (`ai/chats/{user}/{feature}/`) if it does not already exist, based on the `--user` and `--feature` arguments provided to the command.

2. **Chat File Generation**: Depending on whether the `--agent` argument is provided, create a Markdown file in the correct directory with the initial content tailored to include or omit the `agent: {agent}` line. This step also involves generating a unique filename for each chat, possibly using a timestamp or a unique identifier to avoid filename collisions.

3. **Testing and Documentation**: After implementation, tests should be created to ensure the command operates correctly in all expected scenarios, and documentation should be updated to inform users about the new command, including its arguments and usage examples.

Given the task structure and the current progress, the next immediate step is to **generate the code responsible for creating the chat directories and initial chat file** based on the provided command arguments. This involves filesystem operations and decision logic to include the `agent` detail when supplied.

Let's proceed with generating the task for chat directory and file creation:

```task
# Implement Chat Directory and File Creation for 'new' Command
## Agent: coding-agent

## Description
Expand the 'new' command functionality within the `mind-merge` CLI application to include the creation of the necessary directory structure and the initial chat file based on the command arguments (`--user`, `--feature`, `--agent`).

1. **Directory Structure**: Ensure the directories `ai/chats/{user}/{feature}/` are created if they do not exist. Use the `--user` and `--feature` arguments to construct the path.

2. **Chat File Generation**:
   - If the `--agent` argument is provided, the file's initial content should include `agent: {agent}`.
   - If the `--agent` argument is not provided, the initial content should be `# User`.
   
   The chat file should be named using a timestamp or a unique identifier to avoid collisions and saved with a `.md` extension within the appropriate directory.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for filesystem operations, such as failed directory or file creation.

## Expected Outcome
The 'new' command creates the specified directory structure and an initial chat file with the correct content based on whether the `--agent` argument is provided. The command should inform the user of the successful file creation or provide error messages if the operation fails.
```

This task encompasses the core functionality for chat management within the new command, establishing the groundwork for further features and testing.
