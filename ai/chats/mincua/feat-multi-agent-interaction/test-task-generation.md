We need to add a new command that creates a new chat for the user.

The command should be called `new` and should take the following arguments:
 - `--user` - required, the name of the user that the chat is for
 - `--feature` - required, the name of the feature that the chat is about
 - `--agent` - optional, the name of the agent that the chat is with

The command should create a new chat file in the appropriate directory structure based on the provided arguments(ai/chats/{user}/{feature}/{chat-name}.md).
If the user specifies an agent the file should look like this:
```markdown
---
agent: {agent}
---
# User


```

If the user does not specify an agent the file should look like this:
```markdown
# User

```

---
# Agent

To successfully add a new `new` command that creates a chat for the user in the `mind-merge` CLI application, we'll need to follow a multi-step plan. This involves both creating the command with its arguments and implementing the functionality to create the chat according to the given arguments. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Setup CLI Command Structure**: Define the `new` command structure within the oclif framework, including the required `--user` and `--feature` arguments, as well as the optional `--agent` argument.

2. **Command Argument Validation**: Implement validation for the `--user` and `--feature` arguments to ensure they are provided and meet any specific criteria (e.g., character restrictions). For the optional `--agent` argument, provide default behavior in case it's not supplied.

3. **Chat Directory Creation**: Based on the provided arguments, generate a directory structure to store the chat file. This might involve creating nested directories for the user, feature, and agent.

4. **Chat File Generation**: Create a new Markdown chat file within the appropriate directory. This file should include initial metadata (such as date, time, and involved parties) and be ready to accept further chat entries.

5. **Error Handling and Feedback**: Ensure proper error handling is in place for issues such as missing arguments or file system errors. Provide clear feedback to the user upon successful chat creation or if any errors occur.

6. **Testing**: Write tests to verify that the command works as expected, including scenarios with missing required arguments and proper file structure creation.

7. **Documentation**: Update the CLI tool's documentation to include this new `new` command, detailing its arguments and usage.

8. **Review and Refinement**: Once the feature is implemented, review the code for optimization opportunities and ensure it adheres to the project's coding standards.

For the implementation, I'll assume that we already have the setup with oclif and the necessary project structure to add new commands to the CLI tool.

The next step is to start breaking down this plan into smaller, executable tasks that can be delegated to specific AI agents. We'll begin with the setup of the CLI command structure.

ok, you can now generate code for the new command

To begin implementing the `new` command in the `mind-merge` application, we'll start with setting up the command structure using the oclif framework. This involves creating the command file, defining its arguments, and preparing for further implementation of the functionality to generate the chat file.

```task
# Setup 'new' Command in oclif Framework
## Agent: oclif-coding-agent

## Description
Create a new command named `new` within the mind-merge CLI application using the oclif framework. This command should accept three arguments:
- `--user`: This is a required string argument that specifies the name of the user the chat is for.
- `--feature`: This is a required string argument that specifies the name of the feature the chat is about.
- `--agent`: This is an optional string argument that specifies the name of the agent the chat is with.

The command needs to be set up with proper argument parsing and validation to ensure that `--user` and `--feature` are always provided. If `--agent` is not specified, the command should still function but note that the chat involves an unspecified agent.

## Expected Outcome
- A new command file for the `new` command is created within the CLI project.
- The command is correctly configured to accept the `--user`, `--feature`, and optional `--agent` arguments.
- Basic validation is implemented to ensure that `--user` and `--feature` are provided by the user.
- The `new` command is properly registered within the oclif command structure and is discoverable when listing the available CLI commands.

```

After this task is completed, we'll proceed with implementing the functionality for chat directory creation and chat file generation based on the provided arguments.

# Result
The 'new' command was successfully added to the mind-merge CLI application. This command requires `--user` and `--feature` arguments to be set and allows for an optional `--agent` argument. Basic argument validation ensures that `--user` and `--feature` are always provided. The command is configured and should be discoverable and executable within the CLI's command structure.

With the `new` command successfully added to the `mind-merge` CLI application and the foundational setup for argument parsing and validation in place, the next steps involve implementing the logic for creating the chat directory structure and generating the chat file according to the provided arguments. Let's break down these steps into detailed tasks for the next stages of development.

### Step 1: Create Chat Directory Structure

This step involves checking if the appropriate directory structure (`ai/chats/{user}/{feature}`) exists based on the provided arguments and creating it if it does not. This will require handling file system operations, including checking for the existence of directories and creating them accordingly.

### Step 2: Generate Chat File

After ensuring the directory structure is in place, the next step is to generate the chat file with the correct naming convention (`{chat-name}.md`) and initial content. The content of the file will differ based on whether the `--agent` argument was provided. If an agent is specified, the initial content should include the agent's name. If no agent is specified, the initial content should be prepared for user entries.

Given these steps, the task we'll commence with is creating the chat directory structure. Since this involves handling file paths and directories, which is not specific to the oclif framework, the `coding-agent` will be tasked with this functionality.

```task
# Implement Chat Directory Structure Creation
## Agent: coding-agent

## Description
Implement the functionality for creating the chat directory structure within the `new` command. After parsing the `--user` and `--feature` arguments, check if the directory path `ai/chats/{user}/{feature}` exists. If it does not, create the necessary directories to establish the correct structure.

Handle any potential file system errors, such as permissions issues or disk being full, and provide appropriate error messages to the user.

## Expected Outcome
- The command checks for the existence of the directory structure based on the provided `--user` and `--feature` arguments.
- If the directories do not exist, they are created to match the required `ai/chats/{user}/{feature}` structure.
- Error handling is in place for file system-related errors, providing clear feedback to the user.

## File References
- src/commands/new.ts
```

Once we've implemented the directory structure creation, we'll proceed with the chat file generation task. This ensures that the groundwork for storing the chat files is in place before we focus on the actual file content.
