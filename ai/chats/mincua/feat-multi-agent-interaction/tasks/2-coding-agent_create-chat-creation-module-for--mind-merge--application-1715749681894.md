You are working on the following task:
# Task: Create Chat Creation Module for `mind-merge` Application
### Description
Implement a new TypeScript module, named `ChatService`, dedicated to handling chat creation logic. This module will be responsible for the following operations based on provided parameters:

1. **Directory and File Creation**: Given `user`, `feature`, and optionally `agent`, create the directory structure `ai/chats/{user}/{feature}/` if not present. Then, generate a new Markdown chat file within this structure. The filename should be unique, possibly incorporating a timestamp or UUID.

2. **Initial File Content**: The initial content of the chat file should vary based on whether an `agent` is specified:
    - If `agent` is provided, include `agent: {agent}` in the first line.
    - If no `agent` is specified, start with `# User`.

Include error handling within the service to manage filesystem errors gracefully.

### Expected Outcome
A `ChatService` module is created, capable of generating the required directory structure and initializing chat files based on the provided arguments. This service should be ready for integration within the `new` command to streamline chat file creation.

When you finish the task You should generate a message that looks like this:
```task-output
# Result
Describe the result of the task here and any additional information was requested by or is relevant for the user or agent
who created the task.
```

# Agent

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

class ChatService {
    static async createChat(user: string, feature: string, agent?: string): Promise<void> {
        try {
            const basePath: string = path.join('ai', 'chats', user, feature);
            if (!fs.existsSync(basePath)) {
                fs.mkdirSync(basePath, { recursive: true });
            }

            const filename: string = `${uuidv4()}.md`;
            const filePath: string = path.join(basePath, filename);

            const content: string = agent ? `agent: ${agent}\n` : '# User\n';

            fs.writeFile(filePath, content, (err) => {
                if (err) {
                    console.error('Error creating chat file:', err);
                } else {
                    console.log(`Chat file created successfully at ${filePath}`);
                }
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Failed to create chat:', error);
        }
    }
}

export default ChatService;
