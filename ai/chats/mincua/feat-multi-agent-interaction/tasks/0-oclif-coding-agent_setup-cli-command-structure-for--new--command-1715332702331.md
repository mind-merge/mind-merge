You are working on the following task:
# Task: Setup CLI Command Structure for 'new' Command
### Description
Create a new command called `new` within the oclif framework for the `mind-merge` CLI application. This command must accept three arguments:
- `--user` (string): A required argument that specifies the name of the user the chat is for.
- `--feature` (string): A required argument that specifies the name of the feature the chat is about.
- `--agent` (string): An optional argument that specifies the name of the agent the chat is with.

The command should validate that both `--user` and `--feature` are provided and handle cases where `--agent` is not provided. Use placeholder functions to represent the logic that will process these arguments and generate the chat file, as this will be developed in subsequent tasks.

### Expected Outcome
A new command file is created within the oclif project structure. This file should correctly parse the specified arguments, check for the presence of required arguments (`--user` and `--feature`), and include placeholders for handling the command logic. The `--agent` argument should be optional.

Provide clear help text for the command outlining the usage and the arguments, ensuring the CLI's help documentation will guide users in using the `new` command correctly.

When you finish the task You should generate a message that looks like this:
```task-output
# Result
Describe the result of the task here and any additional information was requested by or is relevant for the user or agent
who created the task.
```

# Agent

Based on your requirements, I've created a TypeScript file setup for the `new` command within the oclif framework. This setup includes argument parsing with the necessary validations and placeholders for future business logic implementation.

```typescript
// src/commands/new.ts
import { Command, Flags } from '@oclif/core';

export class NewCommand extends Command {
  static description = 'Creates a new chat for a user concerning a specific feature, optionally with an agent.';

  static examples = [
    '<%= config.bin %> new --user=<user> --feature=<feature>',
    '<%= config.bin %> new --user=<user> --feature=<feature> --agent=<agent>',
  ];

  static flags = {
    user: Flags.string({ char: 'u', description: 'Name of the user the chat is for', required: true }),
    feature: Flags.string({ char: 'f', description: 'Name of the feature the chat is about', required: true }),
    agent: Flags.string({ char: 'a', description: 'Name of the agent the chat is with', required: false }),
  };

  async run(): Promise<void> {
    const { flags } = await this.parse(NewCommand);

    // Placeholder for validation or additional logic to ensure required flags are provided
    if (!flags.user || !flags.feature) {
        this.error('Both --user and --feature flags are required.');
        return;
    }

    // Placeholder for the main command logic
    this.processChatCreation(flags.user, flags.feature, flags.agent);
  }

  private processChatCreation(user: string, feature: string, agent?: string): void {
    // Placeholder for actual chat creation logic
    console.log(`Creating chat for user: ${user} about feature: ${feature} with agent: ${agent}`);
    
    // Simulate chat creation
    // Note: Implement the actual logic for chat creation.
  }
}

export default NewCommand;
```

Please review the code to ensure it meets the requirements. Once approved, the next steps will involve implementing the placeholder function (`processChatCreation`) with actual logic.
