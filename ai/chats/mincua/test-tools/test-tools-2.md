# Agent

Based on the list of project source files, here are the files that are likely related to agents in the `mind-merge` project:

- [src/model/agent.ts](./src/model/agent.ts): This file probably defines the `Agent` model, which is crucial for handling agent-related data structures.
- [src/services/agents-service.ts](./src/services/agents-service.ts): This service file likely contains logic for managing agents, such as CRUD operations or interactions with agents.

These files seem to be the most directly related to agents, based on their names. However, it's possible other files interact with these components or contribute to the agents' functionality indirectly.

ok, now read the content of the file `src/model/agent.ts` and `src/services/agents-service.ts` and summarize it for me.

# Agent

The content of the file `src/model/agent.ts` describes an `Agent` class. Here is a summary of its structure and purpose:

- **Properties**: The `Agent` class includes properties such as `baseDir`, `description`, `fileName`, `format`, `inputData`, `model`, `name`, `outputData`, and `prompt`. These properties likely represent basic information about an agent, including its location, descriptive metadata, and operational parameters.
- **Constructor**: It defines a constructor that initializes an `Agent` object with its properties. Optional parameters include `model`, `inputData`, and `outputData`. The constructor also takes parameters for required properties like `name`, `fileName`, `baseDir`, `format`, `description`, and `prompt`.

The file `src/services/agents-service.ts` contains the `AgentsService` class. Here's an overview of its functionality:

- **Agents Map**: Maintains a map of agent names to `Agent` objects, facilitating retrieval and management of agents.
- **File Watching**: Utilizes `chokidar` to watch for file changes in the `ai/prompts/agents` directory, automatically reloading agents upon modification.
- **Agent Loading**: Provides methods for loading individual agents (`loadAgent`) or all agents (`loadAgents`) from the filesystem. It reads `.md.liquid` files, parses their content with the `gray-matter` library to extract metadata and template content, and initializes `Agent` objects accordingly.
- **Agent Retrieval**: Implements a method (`getAgent`) to retrieve an agent by its name from the agents map.
- **Initialization**: The `initialize` method sets up the file watcher and begins monitoring for agent file changes. It also prints log messages to indicate the commencement of file monitoring and when an agent is loaded.

These files together define the core functionality for handling agent-related data and dynamically loading agent configurations from the filesystem, supporting the runtime modification and extension of agent behaviors within the application.

ok, can we plan a way to let the agents interact with each other?

# Agent

To enable agents to interact with each other within the `mind-merge` application, we can define a high-level plan focusing on the fundamental aspects of agent interaction: discovery, communication, and processing. Each step will include modifications or enhancements to existing components or the addition of new functionalities. 

### Plan for Enabling Agent Interaction

1. **Define Agent Interaction Model**

    Assumption: Agents need to communicate in a loosely coupled manner, allowing for dynamic interactions without hard-coded dependencies.
   
    - Define an `AgentMessage` model to represent communication payloads between agents. Include properties like `sender`, `receiver`, `type`, and `content`.

2. **Enhance Agent Model**

    - Update the `Agent` class to include methods for sending and receiving messages. These can be `sendMessage()` and `receiveMessage()`.
  
3. **Create Agent Registry Service**

    - Implement an `AgentRegistryService` to maintain a registry of available agents. This will support discovery by allowing agents and other parts of the application to query for agents by name, capabilities, etc.

4. **Update Agent Service**

    - Modify the `AgentsService` to automatically register agents in the `AgentRegistryService` upon loading.
    - Add methods to `AgentsService` for direct agent communication, leveraging the registry to find target agents.

5. **Implement Communication Middleware**

    - Develop a middleware or service to handle message validation, routing, and delivery between agents, ensuring that sending and receiving messages are smooth and abstracted away from the agents.

6. **Define Agent Interaction Protocols**

    - Establish conventions or protocols for common types of interactions, ensuring that agents adhere to a standardized method of communication for requests, responses, and notifications.

7. **Test Agent Interactions**

    - Implement test cases to cover various interaction scenarios, ensuring reliability, fault tolerance, and appropriate error handling.

8. **Documentation and Examples**

    - Update project documentation to include details on how to develop agents with interaction capabilities and provide examples of agent interactions.

### Assumptions

- Agents are designed to operate both independently and in collaboration with others.
- Interactions are based on message passing, allowing for flexibility in communication patterns.
- The application's architecture supports dynamic loading and unloading of agents.

### Tools to Use

- TypeScript for development.
- Existing project infrastructure (e.g., classes and services) for modifications.
- Test frameworks integrated into the project for testing new functionalities.

This plan provides a structured approach to integrating agent interaction capabilities into the `mind-merge` application, enhancing its potential for complex, cooperative behaviors among agents.
